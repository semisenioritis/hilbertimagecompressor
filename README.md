# hilbertimagecompressor
this was my third sem computer graphics that apparently wasnt "computer graphics enough" for my prof

so basically this was my 3rd sem project that was basically a stem of me seeing a hilbert curve and wanting to use it for compression. its pretty simple code and i havent implemented any complex data structures so it does run a bit slow. plus it crops the image to a suitable square size and then compresses it. 
i havent commented the code so be ready to debug it at your own risk.
